# Neuro-Symbolic Rule Extraction Survey
## AI Rosetta Stone: Neuro-Symbolic Bridge Component

### Executive Summary
This document surveys cutting-edge techniques for extracting high-fidelity symbolic rules from trained neural networks, focusing on regulatory compliance applications for the EU AI Act.

## 1. Neural Network Rule Extraction Techniques

### 1.1 Gradient-Based Activation Pattern Analysis (GBAPA)

**Core Concept:**
This technique analyzes gradient flows and activation patterns across network layers to identify decision boundaries and extract logical rules. It uses gradient-weighted class activation mapping combined with layer-wise relevance propagation to trace decision pathways.

**Methodology:**
- Compute gradients with respect to intermediate layer activations
- Identify critical neurons and activation thresholds using gradient magnitudes
- Cluster similar activation patterns to form rule antecedents
- Extract IF-THEN rules based on activation threshold combinations

**Pros for Regulatory Compliance:**
- **High Fidelity:** Direct analysis of actual network computations, not approximations
- **Global Coverage:** Can extract rules covering the entire input space
- **Traceable Logic:** Provides clear causal pathways from inputs to outputs
- **Quantifiable Thresholds:** Generates precise numerical conditions for audit trails

**Cons:**
- **Computational Complexity:** Requires significant computation for large networks
- **Rule Explosion:** Can generate thousands of rules for complex models
- **Threshold Sensitivity:** Small changes in thresholds can dramatically alter rule sets

### 1.2 Logic Tensor Networks (LTN) Integration

**Core Concept:**
Retrofits existing neural networks with logical constraints and extracts the learned logical relationships. Uses fuzzy logic operations to represent neural computations as logical predicates.

**Methodology:**
- Define logical predicates corresponding to network layers
- Use t-norms and t-conorms to represent AND/OR operations
- Extract rules by analyzing learned predicate relationships
- Optimize logical constraints during or after training

**Pros for Regulatory Compliance:**
- **Native Logic Representation:** Rules are inherent to the model architecture
- **Regulatory Alignment:** Can directly encode legal constraints as logical predicates
- **Interpretable by Design:** Model is built with explainability as a core feature
- **Consistency Guarantees:** Logical consistency can be formally verified

**Cons:**
- **Architecture Constraints:** Requires modification of existing models
- **Performance Trade-offs:** May reduce model accuracy for interpretability
- **Limited Applicability:** Not suitable for all neural network architectures

### 1.3 Hierarchical Rule Extraction via Layer Decomposition (HRELD)

**Core Concept:**
Decomposes neural networks layer by layer, extracting rules at each level and composing them into hierarchical rule structures. Uses decision tree surrogates trained on intermediate layer outputs.

**Methodology:**
- Extract features from each hidden layer
- Train decision trees on layer outputs using original inputs
- Combine decision paths across layers to form compound rules
- Optimize rule sets for coverage and accuracy

**Pros for Regulatory Compliance:**
- **Hierarchical Understanding:** Provides multi-level view of decision making
- **Human-Readable:** Rules naturally map to business logic structures
- **Modular Auditing:** Can audit different aspects of the model separately
- **Scalable:** Works well with deep networks

**Cons:**
- **Approximation Error:** Decision tree surrogates may not capture full complexity
- **Rule Interdependencies:** Complex interactions between hierarchical levels
- **Validation Complexity:** Difficult to validate rule accuracy across all levels

### 1.4 Neuron-Level Concept Extraction (NLCE)

**Core Concept:**
Identifies individual neurons or neuron groups that encode specific concepts, then extracts rules based on these concept activations. Uses concept activation vectors and network dissection techniques.

**Methodology:**
- Identify concept-encoding neurons using activation maximization
- Map concepts to human-interpretable features
- Extract rules based on concept activation patterns
- Validate concepts against domain knowledge

**Pros for Regulatory Compliance:**
- **Concept Traceability:** Direct mapping to human-understandable concepts
- **Bias Detection:** Can identify neurons encoding protected attributes
- **Fine-Grained Control:** Enables precise rule modification and validation
- **Domain Alignment:** Rules naturally align with business domain concepts

**Cons:**
- **Concept Identification Complexity:** Difficult to automatically identify meaningful concepts
- **Limited Coverage:** May miss distributed representations
- **Subjective Interpretation:** Concept definitions may be ambiguous

## 2. Recommended Approach: Gradient-Based Activation Pattern Analysis (GBAPA)

### Rationale for Selection

GBAPA emerges as the most promising technique for the AI Rosetta Stone's regulatory compliance requirements due to:

1. **Direct Neural Analysis:** Works with actual network computations rather than approximations
2. **High Fidelity:** Maintains mathematical rigor required for legal auditing
3. **Existing Architecture Compatibility:** Works with any trained PyTorch model
4. **Quantifiable Output:** Produces precise thresholds and conditions
5. **Regulatory Mapping:** Rules can be directly tested against legal requirements

### Implementation Feasibility

- Compatible with standard PyTorch models
- Leverages existing gradient computation infrastructure
- Scalable to enterprise-level deployments
- Integrates well with automated compliance checking systems
