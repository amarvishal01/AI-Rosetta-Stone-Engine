## Overview

The **AI Rosetta Stone** is a revolutionary neuro-symbolic engine designed to bridge the critical gap between the computational logic of neural networks and the normative requirements of the EU AI Act. Unlike conventional explainability tools (LIME/SHAP) that provide post-hoc approximations, our system extracts **high-fidelity symbolic rules** directly from trained neural networks, enabling automated regulatory compliance verification.

### üéØ Key Innovation: Gradient-Based Activation Pattern Analysis (GBAPA)

Our breakthrough **GBAPA** technique analyzes gradient flows and activation patterns across network layers to extract precise symbolic rules like:

```
Rule_127: IF (credit_score > 720.4) AND (debt_to_income <= 0.35) THEN decision -> 'approved' (confidence: 0.892)
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Run the Demo (No Dependencies Required)

```bash
git clone <repository>
cd workspace

```

This runs a conceptual demonstration showing rule extraction and compliance analysis.

## üî¨ Technical Approach

### 1. Survey of Cutting-Edge Techniques

We evaluated four state-of-the-art approaches for neural network rule extraction:

| Technique | Fidelity | EU AI Act Suitability | Implementation Complexity |
|-----------|----------|----------------------|---------------------------|
| **GBAPA** (Our Choice) | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê |
| Logic Tensor Networks | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê |
| Hierarchical Rule Extraction | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | ‚≠ê‚≠ê |
| Neuron-Level Concept Extraction | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê |

**Why GBAPA?** 
- ‚úÖ Direct neural analysis (not approximations)
- ‚úÖ Compatible with any PyTorch model  
- ‚úÖ Mathematically rigorous for legal auditing
- ‚úÖ Quantifiable output for regulatory compliance

### 2. GBAPA Methodology

```python
# Core GBAPA Process
def extract_rules(model, X_sample):
    # 1. Register hooks to capture activations
    register_hooks(model)
    
    # 2. Forward pass + gradient computation
    predictions = model(X_sample)
    gradients = compute_gradients(predictions, activations)
    
    # 3. Calculate importance scores
    importance = |gradients √ó activations|
    
    # 4. Cluster activation patterns
    clusters = kmeans(importance, n_clusters=k)
    
    # 5. Extract symbolic rules
    rules = formulate_rules(clusters, thresholds)
    
    return rules
```

### 3. EU AI Act Compliance Mapping

| EU AI Act Article | Compliance Check | Implementation |
|------------------|------------------|----------------|
| **Article 10** (Non-discrimination) | Protected attribute usage detection | `check_protected_features(rules, protected_attrs)` |
| **Article 13** (Transparency) | Rule confidence thresholds | `validate_confidence(rules, min_threshold=0.7)` |
| **Article 14** (Human Oversight) | Decision review triggers | `flag_high_risk_decisions(rules)` |
| **Article 15** (Accuracy & Robustness) | Rule coverage analysis | `assess_coverage(rules, min_coverage=0.05)` |

## üèõÔ∏è Regulatory Compliance Features

### Automated Compliance Reporting

```python
# Generate EU AI Act compliance report
bridge = NeuroSymbolicBridge(model, feature_names, class_names)
rules = bridge.extract_rules(X_sample)
report = bridge.generate_compliance_report(
    rules, 
    protected_features=['age', 'gender', 'ethnicity']
)

print(f"Risk Level: {report.risk_level}")
print(f"Compliant Rules: {report.compliant_rules}/{report.total_rules}")
```

### Example Output

```
üìä EU AI ACT COMPLIANCE REPORT
============================================================
üéØ Model: credit_scoring_model_v1
üìè Total Rules: 12
‚úÖ Compliant: 10
‚ö†Ô∏è  Non-Compliant: 2
üö® Risk Level: MEDIUM

üìú Article-by-Article Compliance:
   ‚Ä¢ Article 10 Non-Discrimination: ‚ùå NON-COMPLIANT
   ‚Ä¢ Article 13 Transparency: ‚úÖ COMPLIANT  
   ‚Ä¢ Article 14 Human Oversight: ‚úÖ COMPLIANT
   ‚Ä¢ Article 15 Accuracy Robustness: ‚úÖ COMPLIANT

üí° Recommendations:
   1. Remove rules using protected attributes
   2. Implement additional bias testing
   3. Establish human oversight for high-risk decisions
