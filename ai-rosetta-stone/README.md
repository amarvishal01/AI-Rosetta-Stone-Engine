# AI Rosetta Stone Engine

**A Neuro-Symbolic Engine for AI Regulatory Compliance**

The AI Rosetta Stone is a novel approach to automated compliance and explainability for the EU AI Act and other AI regulations. It moves beyond conventional explainability tools by providing direct, verifiable mapping between neural network logic and regulatory requirements.

## 🎯 Overview

The AI Rosetta Stone addresses the critical gap between AI model performance and regulatory compliance by:

- **Extracting symbolic rules** from neural networks using advanced neuro-symbolic techniques
- **Formalizing legal requirements** into machine-readable knowledge representations  
- **Mapping model behavior** to specific regulatory articles and requirements
- **Generating compliance reports** that are both human-readable and machine-auditable

## 🏗️ Architecture

The engine consists of four core components:

### 1. Symbolic Knowledge Base
- Ingests and formalizes legal text (EU AI Act, GDPR, etc.)
- Converts regulations into queryable logical representations
- Maintains ontologies for different regulatory domains

### 2. Neuro-Symbolic Bridge  
- Extracts symbolic rules from trained neural networks
- Analyzes activation patterns and decision pathways
- Converts opaque model logic into transparent rules

### 3. Mapping & Reasoning Layer
- Compares model rules against legal knowledge base
- Identifies compliance violations and conflicts
- Performs automated logical reasoning for compliance assessment

### 4. Reporting Engine
- Generates comprehensive compliance reports
- Provides visualizations and audit trails
- Supports multiple output formats (HTML, PDF, JSON)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ai-rosetta-stone/ai-rosetta-stone.git
cd ai-rosetta-stone

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install the package
pip install -e .
```

### Basic Usage

```python
from rosetta_stone import (
    SymbolicKnowledgeBase, 
    NeuroSymbolicBridge, 
    MappingReasoningEngine,
    ComplianceReportGenerator
)
import torch

# 1. Initialize components
knowledge_base = SymbolicKnowledgeBase()
bridge = NeuroSymbolicBridge()
reasoning_engine = MappingReasoningEngine(knowledge_base)
report_generator = ComplianceReportGenerator()

# 2. Load legal documents
knowledge_base.ingest_legal_document("data/eu_ai_act.txt", "eu_ai_act")

# 3. Extract rules from your AI model
model = torch.load("your_model.pt")
sample_data = torch.randn(1000, 10)  # Representative sample
extracted_rules = bridge.extract_rules(model, sample_data)

# 4. Assess compliance
assessment = reasoning_engine.assess_compliance(
    system_id="my_ai_system",
    model_rules=extracted_rules,
    system_type="high_risk"
)

# 5. Generate compliance report
report_generator.generate_compliance_report(
    assessment=assessment,
    output_path="compliance_report.html",
    format="html"
)

print(f"Compliance Status: {assessment.overall_status}")
print(f"Confidence: {assessment.confidence_score:.1%}")
```
